# üó∫Ô∏è Tourism Experience Analytics: Explore, Predict & Recommend

## ‚ú® Introduction

This project delivers an interactive platform for the tourism industry, powered by machine learning and data analytics. It allows users to **explore tourism trends**, **predict user behavior**, and receive **personalized attraction recommendations**, aiming to enhance traveler experiences and inform business strategies.

## üöÄ Key Features & Objectives

* **Interactive Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize popular attractions, user demographics, and travel patterns across regions.
* **Predict User Visit Mode:** Forecast the purpose of a user's visit (e.g., Business, Family, Couples, Friends) based on their profile and trip details.
* **Predict Attraction Rating:** Estimate the rating a user is likely to give an attraction, helping gauge satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
* **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggest attractions tailored to individual user preferences and historical data.

## üìä Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
* **Pandas, NumPy:** For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model development (preprocessing, regression, classification).
* **LightGBM (`LGBMRegressor`):** A high-performance gradient boosting framework used for predicting attraction ratings.
* **RandomForest (`RandomForestClassifier`):** A robust ensemble learning method used for predicting visit modes.
* **Scikit-Surprise (`SVD`):** A specialized library for building and evaluating recommendation systems.
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** For data visualization in EDA.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is logically organized into several Python scripts for clarity and modularity:

* **data_loading.py:** Loads raw CSV datasets and saves them as optimized .pkl format for faster loading.

* **data_preprocessing.py:** Cleans, preprocesses, merges data, and performs feature engineering. Saves processed data (.pkl and a viewable .csv sample).

* **eda.py:** Conducts comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis, generating and saving insightful visualizations.

* **model_training.py:** Trains the machine learning models (Regression, Classification, Recommendation) and saves them along with necessary components (scalers, feature lists, label encoder).

* **model_evaluation.py:** Evaluates the performance of the trained models and generates detailed reports.

* **app.py:** The main Streamlit application, serving as the interactive user interface.

* **Data/:** Directory containing raw CSV data files (e.g., Transaction.csv, User.csv).

* **Pickled_Data/:** Directory for raw data in .pkl format (auto-generated by data_loading.py).

* **processed_data/:** Directory for cleaned and processed data (processed_data.pkl, processed_data.csv) (auto-generated by data_preprocessing.py).

* **eda_plot/:** Directory for saved EDA visualizations (.png) (auto-generated by eda.py).

* **models/:** Directory for trained machine learning models and supporting files (.pkl) (auto-generated by model_training.py).

* **evaluation_results/:** Directory for model performance reports (.pkl, .txt) (auto-generated by model_evaluation.py).

* **.gitignore:** Specifies files and directories to be excluded from version control.

* **requirements.txt:** Lists all Python library dependencies.




## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and launch the project on your machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Roshan-25-cbe/TOURISM-EXPERIENCE-ANALYSIS.git
    cd TOURISM-EXPERIENCE-ANALYSIS
    ```


2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
    * **Windows (PowerShell/CMD):** `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
    * **macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):** `source ./.venv/bin/activate`



3.  **Place Raw Data Files:**
   
    Create a folder named Data in the root of your project directory.
    Place all your original raw CSV dataset files into this Data folder:

    *City.csv

    *Continent.csv

    *Country.csv

    *Mode.csv

    *Region.csv

    *Transaction.csv

    *Type.csv

    *Updated_Item.csv

    *User.csv
  
    Your project structure should look like TOURISM-EXPERIENCE-ANALYSIS/Data/Transaction.csv.



4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    With your virtual environment active, install all required Python libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * *If you encounter `numpy` compatibility issues (e.g., `AttributeError: float object has no attribute 'rmse'` or `ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import`), try reinstalling `numpy` and `scikit-surprise` specifically:*
        ```bash
        pip uninstall scikit-surprise numpy -y
        pip install numpy==1.26.4 # Compatible version
        pip install scikit-surprise
        ```



5.  **Execute Project Pipeline:**
    Run the following scripts sequentially from your terminal (with the virtual environment activated) to process data, train models, and evaluate:

    ```bash
    python data_loading.py
    python data_preprocessing.py
    python eda.py
    python model_training.py
    python model_evaluation.py
    ```



6.  **Launch the Streamlit Application:**
    Once all the above scripts have completed successfully, launch the interactive dashboard:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This command will automatically open the application in your default web browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`).



## üìà Model Performance Highlights

*(Metrics based on evaluation on a test set)*

* **Regression Model (LGBMRegressor) for Attraction Rating:**
    * Mean Squared Error (MSE): **0.8593**
    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): **0.9270** (Average prediction error of ~0.5 stars on a 1-5 scale)
    * R-squared (R2): **0.0876** 

* **Classification Model (RandomForestClassifier) for Visit Mode:**
    * Accuracy: **0.4642** (~50% correct predictions)
    * Precision (weighted): **0.4626**
    * Recall (weighted): **0.4642**
    * F1-Score (weighted): **0.4630**
    * *Note: The classification model's accuracy, while functional, indicates challenges due to significant class imbalance and dataset complexity. Performance varies across different visit modes. Further optimization would focus here.*

* **Recommendation System (SVD):**
    * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): **0.6522**
    * Mean Absolute Error (MAE): **0.5072**




## üí° Future Enhancements

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Develop features like user average ratings, attraction popularity scores, or time-decay features to potentially improve model performance, especially for regression and classification.

* **Hybrid Recommendation Model:** Implement content-based features (e.g., one-hot encode AttractionType, User_Continent_Name) for a library like LightFM to build a truly hybrid recommender system that leverages both user-item interactions and content attributes.

* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Conduct a more exhaustive search for optimal model parameters (n_estimators, learning_rate, etc.) to boost accuracy.

* **Alternative Algorithms:** Experiment with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, neural networks) for prediction tasks.

* **User Interface Refinements:** Enhance the Streamlit UI with more interactive plots, user profiles, and potentially a more dynamic input system for new users.

* **Data Refresh Mechanism:** Implement a way to periodically update the raw data and retrain models.
